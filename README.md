# Annah v1.0.0

Annah is a medium-level total functional programming language that compiles down
to the calculus of constructions
(specifically [Morte](https://github.com/Gabriella439/Haskell-Morte-Library)).

Annah exists primarily as a reference implementation for encoding higher-level
idioms in pure lambda calculus.  Many of these tricks are scattered among papers
and folklore but have never been consolidated into a single focused
implementation that people could learn from, experiment with, or fork for their
own uses.

This project provides three separate features:

* the `annah` compiler, which compiles Annah expressions into Morte
  expressions
* the `annah` Haskell library, used to implement the `annah` compiler
* the Annah Prelude, a small subset of Haskell translated to Annah code

The latest Annah Prelude is hosted online
[here](http://sigil.place/prelude/annah/1.0/)
and can be referenced directly within Annah or Morte expressions.

## Quick start

* Install [the `stack` tool](http://haskellstack.org/)
* Create the following `stack.yaml` file:

    ```bash
    $ cat > stack.yaml
    resolver: lts-8.0
    packages: []
    extra-deps:
    - annah-1.0.0
    <Ctrl-D>
    ```

* `stack setup`
* `stack install annah`

This creates the `annah` executable under `stack`'s default `bin` directory
(typically `~/.local/bin/` on Unix-like systems).  This executable reads Annah
expressions from `stdin`, type-checks them, and outputs the equivalent Morte
expression to `stdout`.  For example:

```bash
$ annah | morte
type Bool
data True
data False
fold if
in

type Nat
data Succ (pred : Nat)
data Zero
fold foldNat
in

let not (b : Bool) : Bool = if b Bool False True
in

let even (n : Nat) : Bool = foldNat n Bool not True
in

even (Succ (Succ (Succ Zero)))
<Ctrl-D>
∀(Bool : *) → ∀(True : Bool) → ∀(False : Bool) → Bool

λ(Bool : *) → λ(True : Bool) → λ(False : Bool) → False
```

You can also reference any expression from the Prelude directly by URL.  For
example, we can transform the above example to use the Prelude like this:

```bash
$ annah | morte
let even (n : http://sigil.place/prelude/annah/1.0/Nat )
    : http://sigil.place/prelude/annah/1.0/Bool =
    n   http://sigil.place/prelude/annah/1.0/Bool
        http://sigil.place/prelude/annah/1.0/Bool/not
        http://sigil.place/prelude/annah/1.0/Bool/True
in

even
(   http://sigil.place/prelude/annah/1.0/Nat/Succ
    (   http://sigil.place/prelude/annah/1.0/Nat/Succ
        (   http://sigil.place/prelude/annah/1.0/Nat/Succ
            http://sigil.place/prelude/annah/1.0/Nat/Zero
        )
    )
)
<Ctrl-D>
∀(Bool : *) → ∀(True : Bool) → ∀(False : Bool) → Bool

λ(Bool : *) → λ(True : Bool) → λ(False : Bool) → False
```

You can also clone the Prelude locally and refer to expression by their relative
path, too:

```bash
$ wget -np -nH -r --cut-dirs=3 http://sigil.place/prelude/annah/1.0/
$ annah | morte
let even (n : ./Nat ) : ./Bool = n ./Bool ./Bool/not ./Bool/True

in  even (./Nat/Succ (./Nat/Succ (./Nat/Succ ./Nat/Zero )))
<Ctrl-D>
∀(Bool : *) → ∀(True : Bool) → ∀(False : Bool) → Bool

λ(Bool : *) → λ(True : Bool) → λ(False : Bool) → False
```

`annah` also provides syntactic support for certain data types, like numeric
literals, so we can shorten this further to:

```bash
$ annah | morte
let even (n : ./Nat ) : ./Bool = n ./Bool ./Bool/not ./Bool/True

in  even 3
<Ctrl-D>
∀(Bool : *) → ∀(True : Bool) → ∀(False : Bool) → Bool

λ(Bool : *) → λ(True : Bool) → λ(False : Bool) → False
```

Here is another example of a list comprehension written in Annah, to illustrate
Annah's support for lists and @do@ notation:

```bash
$ annah | morte
let xs : ./List ./Nat = ./List/Monad ./Nat (do ./List {
        x : ./Nat <- [nil ./Nat , 1, 2, 3];
        y : ./Nat <- [nil ./Nat , 4, 5, 6];
        _ : ./Nat <- ./List/pure ./Nat (./Nat/(+) x y);
    })
in  ./Nat/sum xs
<Ctrl-D>
∀(Nat : *) → ∀(Succ : ∀(pred : Nat) → Nat) → ∀(Zero : Nat) → Nat

λ(Nat : *) → λ(Succ : ∀(pred : Nat) → Nat) → λ(Zero : Nat) → Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ (Succ Zero))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))
```

## How to contribute

Annah is mostly a reference implementation of some things that I've learned
along the way towards building a real production language.  That means that I'm
less likely to improve the polish, error messages, or type inference of Annah,
since I'm dedicating those efforts to a real programming language that will
resemble Annah but provide support for high-efficiency text and numeric
primitives and a real `IO` backend.  However, I will still listen to all feature
requests and if you strongly feel that Annah should be improved in some way
then feel free to open an issue.

Just keep in mind that Annah's primary focus is providing a small, clean, and
easy to understand implementation that other people can easily learn from and
fork to modify to their needs.  That means that I will push back on anything
that greatly complicates the implementation.  Vice versa, anything that
simplifies the implementation is very welcome!

I also welcome contributions to Annah's prelude which you can find here:

https://github.com/Gabriella439/Haskell-Annah-Library/tree/master/Prelude

... and I will periodically upload versioned Preludes online here:

http://sigil.place/prelude/annah/

... so that people can import expressions directly within their own code by
URL.

## Development Status

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Gabriella439/Haskell-Annah-Library.png)](https://travis-ci.org/Gabriella439/Haskell-Annah-Library)

Annah is heavily exercised by the Annah Prelude so most bugs should have been
rooted out by this point.  The most likely bugs that still remain at this point
are in the desugaring logic not correctly avoiding name capture.

The most likely thing to change in the API is support for new desugaring rules
if people request them and are willing to implement them.
